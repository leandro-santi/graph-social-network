# Graph Social Network Sample

This project is an implementation of a [Social Network Graph](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/iii/10.0.0?topic=tool-social-network-graph) using graph theory.

## Brief

This is a console-based prototype of a social network designed to demonstrate how it functions.

* There is a strong connection between the concepts of graphs and social networks.
* In social networks, entities can be individuals, groups, pages, etc., and the relationships between them can be friendships, followers, and more.
* Social networks can be represented as graphs, where vertices represent users and edges represent connections between them (such as friendships and followers).

The sample program includes the following features:

* Create users;
* Add users;
* Show friends' feed;
* Show global feed;
* Search for a user (using BFS);
* Display the global network.

## Technologies

* Java
* IntelliJ IDEA
* Maven
